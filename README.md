### Hello, I'm Nathan!

I would like to learn the other machine learning techniques which are not neural networks. I'm curious to know what other options are avaliable!

I'm currently finishing up several games I'm working on. I enjoy making both computer and board games, and I figure it's about time I start finishing some of the many projects I've started. I'm also on the tennis team here at Coe, and I'm hoping for a good season!
